Hi!

These are five of the Lab Assignments I was assigned during my Computer Logic and Design Course. Involving VHDL, Schematics, and further used for Timing Diagrams.

# Digital Logic Labs (CDA – FAU)

VHDL-based digital logic labs covering multiplexers, full adders, NAND logic,
schematic design, and waveform simulation using Quartus Prime and ModelSim.

## Labs
- [Lab 0](lab0/) – Intro to Quartus, basic adder, simulation
- [Lab 1 Part 2](lab1-part2/) – NAND logic and 2-to-1 MUX
- [Lab 1 Part 3](lab1-part3/) – 4-to-1, 8-to-1, 16-to-1 MUX hierarchy
- [Lab 2](lab2/) – 4-bit and 8-bit full adders (behavioral + structural VHDL)
- [Lab 3](lab3/) – Designed Data Flip Flop using VHDL (behavioral + structural VHDL)
